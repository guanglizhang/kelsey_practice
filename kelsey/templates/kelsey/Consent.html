            <p>
                Welcome to the consent form for this economics study. You must read the
                following carefully before checking the box next to the red informed
                consent statement below the text area to proceed with your participation.
            </p>
            <h3>Procedures:</h3>
            <p>
                You will be asked to make a series of decisions involving different payoffs.
                The entire session, which will include 18 separate decisions, split into two parts,
                will last up to 30 minutes. You will be given detailed information on how to make
                choices and your payment will depend on your decisions.
                The rules and payments may vary across parts and participants. For example,
                you may be asked to select a price at which to buy or sell an object, choose
                how to distribute a sum of money between participants,
                decide how much to donate to a public project, make predictions about
                other participants' decisions, or make a decision in some other context.
                This study follows the standards of experimental economics: participants
                must give their informed consent to participate, they are always paid,
                and they are never deceived.
            </p>
            <h3>Participation:</h3>
            <p>
                 You must be 18 years of age or older to participate. Your
                participation is voluntary, and you may choose not to participate or to
                withdraw from a study at any time and for any reason with no penalty.
            </p>
            <h3>Risks:</h3>
            <p>
                There are no known harms or discomforts beyond those encountered in
                the decision-making of normal daily life. There is no cost to you to
                participating.
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <p>
                 There are no direct benefits to you other than monetary payments,
                but benefits to society include the generalized knowledge gained about
                decision-making.
            </p>
            <h3>Privacy:</h3>
            <p>
                The only personal information that will be available to the
                researchers is what is publicly available on your MTurk profile
                and any information that you choose to provide during the course of the
                study. This information will not be shared with any individuals who are not
                part of the research team.
            </p>
            <h3>Confidentiality:</h3>
            <p>
                 Researchers will be given information about your decisions
                only. They will not be given any personal identifying information. Data on
                decisions will be stored indefinitely for data analysis. Your name will be
                kept separately from data on decisions and will be used for administrative
                purposes only, such as ensuring that you receive your payment. Any
                information derived from this research project that personally identifies
                you will not be voluntarily released or disclosed without your separate
                consent, except as specifically required by law.
            </p>
            <h3>Compensation:</h3>
            <p>
                Every participant is guaranteed at least $7 for participating
                in a session. Additional payments may also be received depending on the
                choices you make and factors determined randomly by the computer or by
                chance. Receipt of these additional payments is conditional upon completion
                of the experiment session. If you withdraw during the study or are
                withdrawn by the research team, then you will still receive the show-up
                payment. Your payment is made privately using the details you have provided
                to Mechanical Turk. The only form of compensation is the monetary
                payment. You will not receive an MTurk rating for this experiment.
            </p>
